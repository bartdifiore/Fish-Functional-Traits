Trait database methods


1. Scraped the FishBase database for traits for each of the species in the trawl survey dataset
2. Gap-filling: 
	a) Compare target species list with Beukoff et al. 2019 data set. 
		- Fill gaps using Beukoff et al. 2019 data set. 
	b) Compare target species list with Thorson et al. 2023 (FishLife) 
		- Fill remaining gaps using Thorson et al. 2023
3. Extract temperature preference zones from Burrows et al. 2019
	- use established species distribution maps to estimate temperature preferences for remaining fish? 
4. Other traits that can be scraped from the SOE reports?
